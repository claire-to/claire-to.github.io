    "text": "Dance\nI often mention how I was forbidden to dance growing up. My parents discouraged it after my cousin majored in dance and struggled with her career. Still, I was always drawn to it through Just Dance, YouTube, and shows like Dance Moms. But I wasn’t allowed to try it myself until college. Maybe if I had gone to school in a more Asian-dominated area, it would’ve felt different, but in middle and high school, I never felt like I belonged there.\nI started with nothing. I had no background in gymnastics or flexibility, and I could barely touch my toes. I didn’t even grow up listening to music. So when I started learning K-pop, I had no rhythm, no sense of sound. I danced by watching movements and matching them to lyrics, not by feeling the beat. But practicing through K-pop gave me enough confidence to step into real dance classes from hip-hop to modern. I especially loved modern dance because the movement felt freeing and expansive, even if I still lacked flexibility and couldn’t hear the music.\nOne style that always captivated me was contemporary. I would watch the dance department showcases and be in awe. It looked so fast, difficult, expressive, and deeply technical. I couldn’t imagine ever being good enough to take that class. For two years, I admired from afar.\nBut after graduating from community college, I felt this pull to try again. That summer, I trained to build the strength and flexibility I thought I’d need. I worked until I could achieve the splits and touch my toes with ease. When I finally enrolled in the contemporary class, I expected to struggle, but to my surprise, I kept up easily. In fact, I physically exceeded many of the dancers who had been dancing since they were kids.\nThat was a strange feeling. Everyone around me had ~20 years of dance under their belt. I had maybe two years. And yet, while my lack of technique showed, especially in musicality and turns, I could keep up. In some areas, I even excelled. My teacher often commented on the contrast: how I could be so flexible and controlled with so little background, and yet also so clearly new to dance in other ways. It’s like there are huge gaps in my ability, some natural strengths, and some deep holes.\nI’m still improving. Month by month, I’m starting to hear the music more, and my turns are slowly getting better. The progress is slow, but I can feel it happening."

    "text": "Computer Science\nWith computer science, I’ve had more struggles than I can count. I didn’t understand pointers, and many concepts made me feel like I was drowning. At one point, I unofficially dropped out of the major, and it was the people around me who gave me the courage to try again. I made it through and transferred, but that wasn’t the end of the story. When I transferred, I realized I was severely behind, especially in algorithm design. I was missing prerequisite knowledge in data structures and algorithms, yet I was expected to keep up with students who had the proper background. That quarter nearly broke me. I was overwhelmed, stressed beyond belief, not just because the content was hard, but because I felt like I was letting down a professor who genuinely believed in me.\nIt didn’t end there either. The next quarter was somehow worse. The week we implemented Zip-Zip trees was the lowest point of my life. The structure was inspired by two data structures: Skip Lists, which I had never encountered, and balanced binary search trees, which I had never implemented. We were expected to code it in Python, a language I had never been properly taught. All of these were prerequisites UCI students had, but I was missing. It wasn’t the only struggle that quarter, but it was the one that hit me the hardest. I cried more during that quarter than in all my academic years combined.\nSomehow, I’m still here. Still struggling, but learning to be proud because I made it through. I’m now pursuing a PhD in algorithms, the very subject I find the most difficult. I took introductory algorithms less than a year before applying. Some days I wonder how I got here, why I was accepted, whether I belong at all because when I say I’m under-qualified, I mean it. My lab-mates say it’s normal to feel that way, but they all had years of theory experience. I had none. Not only that, but I struggled in all my theory classes. They had a years of mathematical maturity, while I barely scraped by with limited math and dismissed classes like discrete math and statistics, thinking I’d never need them — only to now find that they’re the core language of my work.\nI sit in theory talks and often don’t understand. Maybe I’ve trained myself to sit in confusion long enough to stay. Sometimes I tell people how lost I am, and some say it’s okay, while others look genuinely concerned. It feels conflicting. I’ve come to notice that those who have experienced more struggle and made it through tend to insist that I will be okay, while others are not so sure. I hope the handful of people who do believe in me are right, because I have placed my trust in them.\nI’ve always looked up to the theory students. I can’t help but value intelligence and knowledge, and to me, they embodied both. I placed them on a pedestal: intimidating and inspiring. Sometimes I would peek into the lab through the window and see scribbles on the whiteboard. It felt like a different world, one I could never understand. It wasn’t imposter syndrome, at least not at first. Even before I ever considered pursuing theory, I was afraid of that lab. It carried a different air from the others. I never imagined I could be one of them. But somehow, that same lab has become my home, not because I suddenly understand everything, but because I stayed long enough to belong.\nI’m not sure when that shift happened. Maybe it was the environments I was encouraged into, the people I met along the way, and my willingness to stay even when I felt like I didn’t belong. They say your environment shapes who you become, and maybe by putting myself in those rooms, I slowly and unintentionally rewrote my own path without realizing it. One moment later, I look around and realize I’m in the very room, among the very people, that once felt worlds away. And that makes me think maybe that’s what growth is. Not a dramatic transformation, but staying long enough in the discomfort until it starts to feel normal like home.\nStarting theory research has made me cry. I felt so overwhelmed and terrified of disappointing my advisor and worried that he would give up on me. There were days I’d reread a single paragraph over and over, unable to make sense of it, but I still kept showing up and trying. Slowly, painfully but slowly, I’m staring to feel the slightest bit of progress. I can follow research meetings better. My lab-mate’s explanations are a bit clearer, when not too long ago, I couldn’t comprehend much of what he said. I can read and dissect a proof without immediately feeling overwhelmed. It’s still beyond difficult, but I’m starting to see small pieces click into place.\nI don’t know how fast I’m supposed to be progressing. I don’t know what’s expected of me. But I hope that my effort will eventually be enough."

    "text": "Friendships\nAs for friends, I’ve had to rebuild my social circle from scratch. It forced me to take initiative and present myself as the person I wished I was. I was never that social girl, or the popular one, or the confident one, the one unafraid to speak up. I wanted to be her, but the gap between who I was and who I wanted to be felt so vast that it almost felt like acting. I was playing a role to be likable, someone accepted.\nOver time, I started to become that person. Not by pretending, but by slowly stepping into it until it felt natural. Now, I’m someone who can be warm and outgoing when needed, while still keeping my core beliefs and values unshakable and true to myself. Having had to start over before, I now trust that I’ll be okay wherever I go because I know how to rebuild from nothing.\nMaybe all of these experiences are why I am who I am today. I don’t know what the future holds or if everything will crash and burn one day. But I want to believe that all this struggle wasn’t for nothing. That everything I’ve learned — the pain, the persistence, the growth — will lead to some kind of success, whatever that ends up meaning for me. I’ve rebuilt before. I’ve started from the beginning in so many areas of my life: physically, intellectually, socially. And I think, no matter what happens, I’ll be able to do it again if I need to."

    "title": "Graduate Application Essay",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Many graduate programs ask for two essays: a Personal History Statement and a Statement of Purpose, which is typically unique for each individual school. Here’s my Personal History Statement, where I share the story of my academic journey and everything that has shaped me along the way.\n\nStanding on the edge of my first C++ course amidst the pandemic, I never imagined that I would one day strive to pursue a PhD in computer science. My journey through undergraduate education has been one of many twists and turns, filled with highs and lows, that have shaped who I am today. The experiences, relationships, and challenges have driven me in unanticipated ways, teaching me the importance of resilience, self-belief, and the powerful influence of those who believe in you.\nAt the start of my computer science courses, I was still in high school, dual-enrolled, navigating college-level coursework at a time when the world had moved online. While my introductory course was manageable, the transition to subsequent courses was challenging. Without a peer support system or opportunities for collaboration, I felt overwhelmed and was left to tackle my problems alone. These struggles destroyed my confidence, and for a long time, I convinced myself that this field was not for me. Although my parents were supportive of whichever path I pursued, their encouragement unintentionally reinforced my own belief that I was not capable of succeeding in computer science.\nThe following year, I enrolled in community college full-time. I stepped away from computer science, exploring my other interests in business, economics, and language. In-person classes resumed, and during this time, I met friends majoring in computer science who inspired me to audit their classes, having already received credit. Revisiting the material gave me a stronger understanding and clarity that I hadn’t had before. I found myself capable of helping my friends with the coursework. By explaining concepts to others, I regained confidence in my own knowledge.\nI came to appreciate the profound value of collaboration and discussion. When I found myself part of a more supportive and collaborative environment, I realized what I had initially missed out on by not having peers to work through difficult material with. Not only did learning become more manageable, but it taught me that working together can strengthen our understanding in ways that studying alone often cannot.\nMy foundation in programming strengthened unintentionally through this process, prompting me to push myself further in more advanced courses. A significant turning point came when I met Professor Gabriela Ernsberger. Her belief in me became a powerful motivator during my times of doubt. With her support, I excelled in my studies and performed exceptionally well.\nDespite these accomplishments, I remained hesitant and felt un-belonging in computer science. When it was time to apply for university transfer, I felt uncertain whether I could handle upper-division courses and complete a degree in computer science. It wasn’t until my professors and peers urged me to apply, insisting that not doing so would be a missed opportunity, that I decided to take the risk. To my surprise, I received an offer of admission, and I committed to UCI’s Computer Science program along with some of the same friends who had helped influence my academic journey.\nMy transition to UCI was far from seamless. In my first quarter, I felt lost and overwhelmed by the large class sizes. The sheer number of students made it difficult to engage with professors and peers. Once again, I felt isolated and struggled to make lasting connections. The environment wasn’t conducive to my growth, and I began questioning whether I had made the right choice.\nEverything changed when I enrolled in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I was excited about the class from the start; the topic sounded intriguing, and the energy in the room was unlike anything I had experienced. Despite the large class size, Professor Michael Shindler’s passion and enthusiasm created an engaging environment. He truly cares for all his students and wants the best for them. For the first time at UCI, I felt a sense of connection and community. His class reignited my passion, reminding me of the happiness I felt when I first began studying the subject.\nNevertheless, my time in his class wasn’t without its struggles. Most of my classmates had taken the prerequisites at UCI, while I was one of the few relying on transfer credits. Consequently, I missed concepts unique to UCI’s version of the course, which were directly referenced with the expectation of prior study. As a result, I often felt behind and spent extra hours learning the concepts my classmates already knew, but I didn’t mind. My dedication kept me motivated, and I ultimately performed far better than I ever imagined. Rather than feeling exhausted by the end, I emerged more confident and with a new perspective on success: it’s not about being naturally gifted, but about persistence, resilience, and commitment. Surviving that experience gave me the courage to finish my degree and succeed in increasingly difficult courses. As I proceeded to subsequent classes, I found myself struggling less as my foundation grew stronger. The initial gaps I faced in understanding became stepping stones, and over time, I filled the gaps in my knowledge that I once lacked.\nDuring these demanding times, I’ve grown not only as a student but also as a person. I’ve learned that failure and struggle aren’t setbacks; they’re growth opportunities. With each obstacle and mental barrier I overcome, I often look back and realize that the problems, that once felt insurmountable, now seem effortless, driving me to continue pushing the boundaries of my understanding. I’ve developed a profound appreciation for the power of belief in shaping success — both self-belief and the belief others have in us — understanding that the only limits to our abilities are those we set in our minds. Along the way, I’ve realized the true value of education. The further I go, the more my mind opens to new ways of thinking, with each discovery unlocking doors to even more questions and concepts to explore. This journey has deepened my understanding of the unique ways people think and the diverse perspectives that shape how we approach and interpret the world.\nThese experiences have instilled in me a deep fulfillment for both learning and teaching, inspiring me to help others facing similar struggles. As the first in my family to pursue graduate education, I recognize the challenges of navigating unfamiliar paths. Throughout my journey, I discovered I am not only capable of adapting to new and unfamiliar environments but also thriving in them. I am confident that my adaptability and perseverance will allow me to navigate the PhD program and contribute to a community of growth and innovation.\nAs I embark on this next chapter, I do so with gratitude for the people who have inspired and supported me, for the adversities that have made me stronger, and for the experiences that have brought me to this point. I look forward to continuing and embracing my journey in this academic environment that I’ve come to treasure, knowing that it will be filled with new challenges and opportunities for growth. And as I do so, I hope to be a source of guidance and encouragement for others who, like me, need someone to believe in them and to show them that anything is possible."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I had a discussion with my family about nature vs. nurture — a deeply personal debate that reflects how we perceive our potential and how much we’re willing to endure to reach it.\nMy family believes that there is a personal limit to everything, and that no amount of training or effort can push you beyond a level you don’t innately possess. I agree with them to an extent when it comes to physical traits. Some physical attributes are essential for professional athletes, and many can’t attain them no matter how much they train. Even then, I’ve heard many stories where people have defied what should’ve been possible for them. On the other hand, when it comes to mental abilities, the situation feels more nuanced.\nI believe in neuroplasticity which is the ability of our brain to adapt and evolve. Skills such as public speaking, for example, seem to be one that can be learned and refined with enough training. I believe such skills don’t have a hard limit.\nMaybe it’s overly optimistic, but when it comes to abilities such as intelligence, I think there’s more to it. I know that not everyone can be an Einstein, but I do think that most people never come close to reaching their true potential. Too often, people assume their limits are far lower than they actually are, and give up far too early when things begin to feel difficult. But it’s during these moments of struggle that we experience the most growth and emerge stronger on the other side.\nFrom my experience in academia, it’s hard not to feel this way especially when I’m surrounded by some of the most intelligent people. There are moments when I feel like I don’t belong, that I’m not cut out for this. As a result, I’ve nearly held myself back time and time again.\nI was trapped my own self-doubt. I couldn’t escape the perspective I had built around something I hadn’t yet experienced and knew so little about from the outside. I simply believed that only those born with a certain level of intelligence could accomplish it and that I was nowhere near qualified.\nIt wasn’t until I met someone at the right moment who unknowingly changed my life that made me see everything in a different light. They once told me:\n“I just wanted you to not worry too much about holding yourself back, because I don’t think you should be the one holding yourself back. Let the world do that. Let the world tell you you’re not good enough and then ignore it.”\nThose words felt so empowering. It brought me a newfound feeling of hope and courage into my life. It made me realize how often I’d given up before the world ever had the chance to stop me.\nIn my moments of doubt, my parents were supportive of me stepping away. They didn’t see the value in pushing further when the challenges felt like too much of a struggle. They often praised how far I’d come, but at the same time, they would say they couldn’t have done it themselves.\nI don’t think that’s true.\nI never felt like I possessed innate talent in this field of study. Nothing has ever come easy to me; I had to work and struggle for every single piece of it. That’s exactly why I believe anyone can do it with enough stubbornness and perseverance.\nIn my times of uncertainty and doubt, it was those who had already been ahead of me and had gone through the same challenges that encouraged me to keep going. From community college to my bachelor’s degree and now pursuing a PhD, at each pivotal phase in my life, those who haven’t experienced the journey themselves feared it and questioned whether I could do it, while those who had walked the path believed it was possible.\nIf not for the people I met along the way, I may not be where I am today. Maybe I wouldn’t even believe in the possibility of reaching my limits.\nI think it’s a tragedy that so many people give up the moment things get tough, and never discover how far they can really go. Like standing at the bottom of a mountain — you don’t know if you’ll make it over, but if you do, you might discover something you never imagined on the other side, and everything in between.\nSo why not try? Try until you fail, and only then will you discover your true limit."
