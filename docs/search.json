    "text": "I’ve noticed that a lot of students – whether they’re currently taking algorithms or have already completed the course – often confuse cases with bounds when discussing algorithm analysis. I know I personally have had to wrestle with this concept myself for quite a while.\nMy hope is that this helps clear up some of that confusion and provides an intuitive, tangible overview of these concepts. It’s not meant to be a comprehensive or formal discussion, as there are already countless resources online, but rather a more approachable supplement for those who already have some background."

    "text": "Case Analysis\nWhen analyzing how long an algorithm takes, we consider how it behaves in different cases, depending on the input.\n\nBest Case\nThe shortest possible time an algorithm takes on any input.\nFor example, when searching for a number in a list, the best case could be finding it at the first index. In insertion sort, the best case is when the array is already sorted.\nThis is less useful in practice, since it’s too optimistic and best case scenarios are unlikely to happen.\n\n\nWorst Case\nThe longest possible time an algorithm takes on any input.\nFor example, the worst case in searching for a number in a list is when the number is found at the very last position checked or not found in the list at all. In insertion sort, the worst case occurs when the array is reverse-sorted.\nThis is the most pessimistic, but also a reliable way to measure an algorithm’s performance because it guarantees that the algorithm will always run within a certain time.\n\n\nAverage Case\nThe expected runtime over all inputs, assuming a certain input distribution.\nThat means we average the running times of the algorithm over all possible inputs, weighted by their probability.\n\nProbability Distributions\n\nUniform distribution: Models all input where each instance is equally likely. Most common in average-case analysis of general algorithms.\nBernoulli distribution: Useful when inputs are sequences of binary events (success/failure). Most common in probabilistic or randomized algorithms.\nGeometric distribution: Models the number of trials until the first success. Most common in probabilistic or randomized algorithms."

    "section": "Asymptotic Bounds",
    "text": "Asymptotic Bounds\nIn algorithm analysis, we often use asymptotic bounds to describe how an algorithm’s running time grows as the input grows larger.\nYou can visualize this by plotting the runtime for increasing input sizes and comparing it to well-known functions like \\(n\\), \\(n \\log n\\), or \\(n^2\\). This is the core idea behind asymptotic comparison of growth rates.\n\nUpper Bound\nAn upper bound usually describes the maximum amount of work a specific algorithm requires to solve a problem.\nAn upper bound for a problem is established by providing an algorithm that achieves that bound. Thus, an algorithm’s upper bound also provides an upper bound for the problem it solves.\nUpper bounds are often proven using:\n\nDirect algorithm analysis\nRecurrence relations\nAmortized analysis\n\n\n\nLower Bound\nWhen discussing lower bounds, it’s important to distinguish between a bound on a specific algorithm and a bound on the inherent difficulty of a problem.\n\nFor a Specific Algorithm\nA lower bound for an algorithm indicates the minimum amount of work that specific algorithm requires to solve a problem in a given case, usually in the worst case.\nLower bounds for algorithms are often proven using:\n\nDirect algorithm analysis\n\n\n\nFor a Problem\nA lower bound for a problem indicates the minimum amount of work any correct algorithm requires to solve a problem, always in the worst case.\nThis is a much stronger statement about the fundamental, inherent difficulty of the problem itself. Lower bound proofs for problems establish the theoretical best performance achievable under a defined model of computation.\nFor example, searching for an element in an unsorted list requires \\(n\\) comparisions because we must check every element. Otherwise, we might miss the one we didn’t check, and that could’ve been the correct one.\nLower bounds for problems are often proven using:\n\nCounting arguments\n\nDecision trees\n\nAdversary arguments\n\nInformation theory\nReductions (P ?= NP)"

    "text": "Asymptotic Notation\nIn theoretical computer science, unless specified otherwise, asymptotic notation usually refers to the worst case. In practice, especially with randomized algorithms or heuristics, expected or average case complexity may be more relevant.\n\nBig O: \\(O(f(n))\\)\nAn upper bound that shows the algorithm \\(A\\)’s running time grows no faster than some function \\(f(n)\\) as the input size grows.\nThe function \\(f(n)\\)’s graph is asymptotically above or equal to algorithm \\(A\\)’s graph.\n\n\nBig Omega: \\(\\Omega(f(n))\\)\nA lower bound that shows the algorithm \\(A\\)’s running time grows no slower than some function \\(f(n)\\) as the input size grows.\nThe function \\(f(n)\\)’s graph is asymptotically below or equal to algorithm \\(A\\)’s graph.\n\n\nTheta: \\(\\Theta(f(n))\\)\nThis indicates a tight bound. In other words, for a specific algorithm, its upper and lower bounds are equivalent up to constant factors. This gives us a very precise understanding of how that algorithm’s runtime grows.\nThe function \\(f(n)\\)’s graph is asymptotically equivalent to algorithm \\(A\\)’s graph.\nSolving recurrance relations, such as by using the Master Theorem, gives us a tight bound on that algorithm’s performance.\nAn algorithm is considered asymptotically optimal for a problem when it has a tight bound that matches the problem’s proven lower bound, meaning we have found the fastest possible algorithm for that problem. If an algorithm’s worst-case upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem it solves, then it is implied that the algorithm has a tight bound.\n\n\nLittle o: \\(o(f(n))\\)\nSimilar to Big O, but shows the algorithm \\(A\\)’s running time is strictly slower than \\(f(n)\\).\nThe function \\(f(n)\\)’s graph is asymptotically above algorithm \\(A\\)’s graph.\nFor example, \\(n\\) grows strictly slower than \\(n \\log n\\).\n\n\nLittle omega: \\(\\omega(f(n))\\)\nSimilar to Big Omega, but shows the algorithm \\(A\\)’s running time is strictly faster than \\(f(n)\\).\nThe function \\(f(n)\\)’s graph is asymptotically below algorithm \\(A\\)’s graph.\nFor example, \\(n \\log n\\) grows strictly faster than \\(n\\).\n\nRemember, cases describe an algorithm’s performance on specific types of input, while asymptotic bounds and its notation describe its growth rate relative to increasing input size. I hope this helps clear up some common misconceptions!"
