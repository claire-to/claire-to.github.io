## About

Hello! I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine in the [Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation](https://ics.uci.edu/~theory/). I'm honored to be advised by [Dr. Michael Goodrich](https://ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/).

## Research

My research is in Theoretical Computer Science, with a focus on algorithms and data structures for computational geometry. I became interested in research through my work in computer science education, and that experience inspired my pursuit of a PhD. Though my path here was unexpected, I am grateful for the journey that led me to this field.
