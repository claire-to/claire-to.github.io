## About

Hello! I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine in the [Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation](https://ics.uci.edu/~theory/). I'm honored to be advised by [Dr. Michael Goodrich](https://ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/).

## Research

My research lies within the field of Theoretical Computer Science. I naturally gravitate toward algorithms and data structures, particularly when applied to problems in computational geometry. My interest in research grew from my experiences in computer science education, which reshaped how I think about learning and inspired me to pursue a PhD.
