## About

Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine in the [Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation](https://ics.uci.edu/~theory/). I'm honored to be advised by [Dr. Michael Goodrich](https://ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/).

## Research

My current research area within algorithm theory is computational geometry, where I work on developing and analyzing geometric algorithms to produce theoretically elegant results. My interest in research grew from my involvement in computer science education, which sparked a deeper appreciation for learning and inspired me to pursue a PhD.
