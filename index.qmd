## About

Hello! I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine in the [Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation](https://ics.uci.edu/~theory/). I'm honored to be advised by [Dr. Michael Goodrich](https://ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/).

## Research

My research is in theoretical computer science, with a primary interest in computational geometry, though I also explore a range of problems in algorithms and data structures. My curiosity for research grew from my early work in computer science education and was further inspired as I explored experimental algorithms and computational geometry. The path that brought me here has been unconventional, guided by the people and opportunities along the way, and I’m grateful for the journey and how it has shaped my perspective on the field.
